  question: "How can AI automation help Amazon sellers?",
  answer:
    "AI automation takes over repetitive work like drafting listing content, watching inventory and summarizing reports. Amazon now offers tools for this, including its free Seller Assistant, which can monitor your account and act with your approval. You still make the decisions, so AI saves you time without replacing your judgment.",
