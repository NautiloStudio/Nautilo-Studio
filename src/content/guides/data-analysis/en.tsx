  question: "Which Amazon numbers should sellers track?",
  answer:
    "Start with four numbers for each product: sessions, conversion rate, whether you hold the Featured Offer, and your advertising cost of sales (ACOS). Together they show whether a problem is about being found, being chosen or spending too much on ads. Check them every week, compare them with the week before, and change one thing at a time.",
