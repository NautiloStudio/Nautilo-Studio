  question: "How does a conversion rate optimization agency optimize an Amazon listing?",
  answer:
    "Listing optimization is conversion rate optimization for Amazon: improving your title, bullet points, images and A+ content so that shoppers who land on your page choose to buy. Start with clear images and a title that says exactly what the product is, then use your bullet points to answer the questions buyers have before they order. Test one change at a time and keep the version that sells better.",
