  question: "How do you rank higher in Amazon search results?",
  answer:
    "Amazon shows the products that best match a search and that shoppers are most likely to buy. Put the words shoppers type into your title, bullets and backend search terms, then make the listing convincing enough to sell. Those sales, with good listing quality, push the product higher over time.",
